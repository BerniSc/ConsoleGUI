Project to write a simple, universal console GUI for providing Sliders, Buttons etc to change Parameters in realtime.

The selected Row can be changed by pressing 'w' for up or 's' for down. The value can be changed (single) by 'a' or 'd' or bulk-wise by 'A' or 'D' and toggled by Space.
The GUI Application is closed by pressing 'q'.

The Idea is that for example the GUI is put before the real programm an the parameters are added. After selecting the desired Value the GUI can be exited by pressing 'q' and the real programm can Load.
